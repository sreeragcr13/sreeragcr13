# 👋 Hi, I'm Sreerag C R

**🎯 Data Engineer in Progress | Data Analyst | Ex-Alstom | Mechanical Engineer turned Data Professional**

I'm passionate about solving problems with data. With 2.5 years of experience as a Product Cost Analyst at Alstom, I built a strong analytical foundation working with cost, procurement, and engineering datasets. Since then, I've been transitioning into Data Engineering, focusing on cloud, ETL pipelines, and modern data tools.

Currently, I'm building real-world projects in AWS, Azure, Python, SQL, Power BI, and big-data platforms to deepen my end-to-end data engineering skills.
